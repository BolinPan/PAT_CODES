Steps to get started

1.) Install k-wave
2.) Setup (new) python environment
    - Either via Anaconda
    - In terminal via 'conda create'
3.) Install needed packages in pyhton environment. Open terminal and install 
    following packages via 'pip install PACKAGE_NAME':
    - h5py
    - matplotlib
    - numpy (probably installed)
    - tensorflow (if 'pip install' fails, try 'conda install')
    - scikit-image
    
    
Run codes in order:
i.) createForwMat.m
ii.) callNetwork_train.py

4.) If you want to use tensorboard
    - set 'useTensorboard = True' in callNetwork.py, line 36
    - Change directory "tensorboardDefaultDir =  '/Path4tensorboard/' " in PATnets.py, line 14
      (This is were the logging files will be saved) See https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard
      for information how to call tensorboard
