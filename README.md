# Learned image reconstruction for photoacoustic tomography

This repository collects accompanying code and examples for the review paper:  Andreas Hauptmann and Ben Cox "Deep learning in photoacoustic tomography: current approaches and future directions," Journal of Biomedical Optics 25(11), 112903. https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JBO.25.11.112903 

Provided codes will be developed further and updated. We aim to provide full accompanying code within the two main frameworks for pyhton: TensorFlow and pyTorch

Current status (28 October, 2020):

- Tensorflow v1: All examples implemented
- pyTorch: post-processing with U-net implemented (almost)
